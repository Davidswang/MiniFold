# The MiniFold Journey

This document is intended to serve as a guide for those who would like to know how was the development process of the MiniFold project. Here there is a sequential explanation of the actions taken that lead to this final repo.

## December 2018 (first days)
I first read about AlphaFold in Twitter and found it impressive. At the time I was dealing with university exams so I had no time to take a look in depth, just read [DeepMind's blog post](https://deepmind.com/blog/alphafold/) and was amazed by it.

I'm studying Medicine right now so it was a huge advance in a field related to my main area of study. 

## 25th January
I finished my exams the day before and watched [Siraj's video on YT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw6_OP5An8s) explaining AlphaFold (I strongly recommend you to watch it if you haven't). It sparked my curiosity but at that time the challenge was too big for me.

## 15th February
I started to think that replicating AlphaFold could be a nice project for the summer/spare time but didn't took it too serious. 

## 18th February
I looked for inspiration at Siraj's vid comment section in order to see if somebody had attempted something and gather ideas for my project, but didn't see any project, so the crazy idea of making it as soon as possible came to my mind.

## 18-27th February
I tried many things during this week (most of them didn't work) and read some papers about Protein Structure Prediction using AI/Deep Learning techniques. I found it very hard to implement the models described there because no official implementations were made available and I had to reverse-engineer them with much fewer data and computational power.

Information about AlphaFold was scarce but finally I managed to get some information about their architecture somehow. From then I tried to implement it and it worked more or less. [Limitations](readme.md#Limitations)) have been a big constraint during the project development but I'm satisfied about the results obtained given the tools I had at my disposure.

I'm happy to have released my results so far and thankful for the acceptance of the community. I will [continue working on it](future.md) and upgrading the models. Stay tuned.

## Final Comments 
It has been an amazing experience and I've been able to work in the intersection of my 2 passions: AI and Medicine/Biology. I plan to continue making upgrades on this project, but at a much lower pace than I did during this week since it's not sustainable ;)
